# English Premier League Results Database (MySQL)

This is a raw set of imported data from http://www.football-data.co.uk with each Premier League CSV results data file at http://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php raw SQL imported using PhpMyAdmin into a separate table, numbered EPL1993-EPL2017 (will need to be updated regularly until the season is over).

A table with raw data of all of the combined results from each season 'EPL.SQL' has been created with an ad-hoc script 'goals.php' which was used to process each CSV file to generate some SQL.  This script can be modified to do many other things, I'll leave that to you!

Please refer to `notes.txt` for information about what the data means as well as the original source material for the data at http://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php
